When I feel a strange or complicated emotion, I’ll hold onto that, then unravel it through drawing. My characters also have an aspect of self-portraiture to them, as I am often infusing aspects of my identity. I’ve been exploring paper-making more, which allows me to get to the root of both my art practice and my identity. I use this fiber called abacá, which is a natural leaf fiber grown in the Philippines. I like that I can connect with that aspect of my culture through my art.” Art by @gracesrealm",1 d

“My motivation is to help and heal as many people as I can while healing myself in the process.” —@flowerkidmusic (Flynn Sant, aka flowerkid) Themes like mental health awareness, childhood trauma and day-to-day struggles runs through flowerkid’s lyrically fearless, fragile music. “I try to provide as much hope as I can to those who need it. These things and honest storytelling make my music uniquely mine,” says the Australia-based musician. “I socially transitioned when I was 17 and physically began to transition when I was 18. My vocal journey as an artist has been one of the hardest parts — experiencing dysphoria because I couldn’t go through hormonal treatment while I was performing last year. Although I experience these negative emotions sometimes, I still feel euphoric with the progress I’ve already made and that I’m able to present myself to the world in my true form. The most important part of my career is helping people, and a huge part of that for me is to represent to the LGBTQ+ community in any way that I can. As a trans man, I feel a responsibility to protect fellow trans kids and adults. I want us to be treated just like any other human. It’s important to be as honest and open as possible. In my experience, the honesty tends to help people the most.” Photo of @flowerkidmusic by @elli0ttMusic by @flowerkidmusic
